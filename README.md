Software specialist, enthusiastic about teaching and learning edge technologies,
with experience in academic environments, industrial and Research and Develop
environments. I'm studying master's degree in Software Engineering at IAU-NTB in
the field of digital healthcare 4.0. I'm working on my thesis about developing
a novel digital healthcare system in mHealth, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)

launching my integrated system in digital healthcare systems within the world of
Copilots and AI assistants!
