Software specialist, enthusiastic about teaching and learning edge technologies, with experience in academic environments, industrial and Research and Develop environments. I'm studying master's degree in Software Engineering at IAU-NTB in the field of digital healthcare 4.0. I’m an indie developer working on an innovative digital healthcare startup. Currently, I’m actively pursuing preseed funding to recruit talented experts and expand our operations into the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and other Middle Eastern countries to have better development opportunity. In the future, we need embedded programmers, software and AI engineers especially in Iran. But with a volunteer based team, continuing without funding is unsustainable. So I'm desire to get cold call with investors who are interested in supporting and investing in our early stage startup. I'm able to online or in person meeting in UAE or Saudi Arabia.",

In our startup, we are revolutionizing digital healthcare by providing hardware and secure, intelligent software solutions. By integrating AI into our services, we aim to empower patients and healthcare professionals alike, ensuring more intelligent decision-making and improved care outcomes. At first phase, we are working on integration of Patients and Clinicians communication together with a GenAI medical assistant. We're designing a prototype and I called it MedLife T1. It's heart of this digital healthcare system. With this hardware we can measure the patient's vital signs in secure data communication. After first phase, we will make a smart wristband for patients and provide more AI tools to our AI platforms (we called it Humera). \"Humera\" has its roots in Old Persian from the Achaemenid era. \"Hume\" means savior or helper, and \"mera\" means \"me\" or \"my.\" Ultimately, \"Humera\" means \"my savior!\"",
